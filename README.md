# wordpress-child-theme-twentyseventeen-textfooter
A wordpress child theme for the twenty seventeen theme. Restyles the social menu on the bottom to have text links instead of icon links. This is useful especially in Germany if you want to put some of the required links in there. Also removes the 'Proudly powered by Wordpress line'.


## Preview

Have a look at the following image if you want a preview of this style. In this example, I have added 3 text links (titled `Kontakt`, `Datenschutz`, and `Impressum`) to the footer menu.

## Installation

1) On your server, copy the directory `twentyseventeen-child/` from this repo to `<your-wordpress-dir>/wp-content/themes/`. Make sure the directory and all its contents have proper access rights so your web server can read the files.

    - Check: as a result, you should now have the following file: `<your-wordpress-dir>/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen-child/style.css` (and some more in the same location).

2) Activate the child theme in the Wordpress Admin panel (see `Appearance => Themes`).

3) You may have to re-save your menus and theme options (including background and header images) in the Wordpress Admin panel (see `Appearance => Menus`).
