# wp-child-theme-twentyseventeen-wohngeno
A wordpress child theme for the twenty seventeen theme.

Restyles the social menu on the bottom to have text links instead of icon links. This is useful especially in Germany if you want to put some of the required links in there.


## Installation

1) On your server, copy the directory twentyseventeen-child/ from this repo to <your-wordpress-dir>/wp-content/themes/.

2) Activate the child theme in the Wordpress Admin panel (see Appearance => Themes).
